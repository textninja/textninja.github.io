# Daily Tech Challenge #6
## Building a simple blog with Jekyll

Today, my challenge was to explore Jekyll and build a simple blog with it. I was
expecting it to be a rather easy challenge, and a change of pace after slogging
through uncharted territory in React Native. It is now the 11th hour, with no
time to spare, and I haven't much of a blog, or blog post, to show for it.

So what happened? Well, you see, I was fully aware that today's challenge was on
the easy side of things, so to really push my time management skills to the
limit, I decided to promise everyone lasagna for dinner. The lesson, it turns
out, is not to try to do too many things at once. One of the lasagnas came out
terribly.

I ran out of time to do anything visually or technologically impressive (is
something you can learn and do in a day ever that way?), but here's what I did
manage:

1. Jekyll is running locally
2. Jekyll is running on GitHub pages
3. The contents of a file in a **_data** folder are included in a template
4. I created two different layouts:
   - bare layout, which includes nothing
   - basic layout, which includes a header and a footer with navigation
5. Neither of the above layouts were styled, but I did load some scss, which
   Jekyll processes for me automatically.

Besides that, just some faffing about. I probably ought to have made the
challenge success criteria more concrete, and probably scoped down. What is the
measure for success here? Just running Jekyll? Do I want something that looks
good?

# Daily Tech Challenge #6
## Building a simple blog with Jekyll

Today, my challenge was to explore Jekyll and build a simple blog with it. I was
expecting it to be a rather easy challenge, and a change of pace after slogging
through the more challenging trials of React Native, but here I am, in the 11th
hour, with hardly any time to spare, and not much of a blog to show for it.

What happened, you see, is because I was aware today's challenge was on the
easier side, I decided to make a lasagna. The lesson, it turns out, is not to
try to do too many things at once. One of the lasagnas came out of the oven a
mess.

I ran out of time to do anything interesting, but here's what I did manage:

1. Jekyll is running locally
2. Jekyll is running on GitHub pages
3. The contents of a file in a **_data** folder are included in a template
4. I created two different layouts:
   - bare layout, which includes nothing
   - basic layout, which includes a header and a footer with navigation
5. Neither of the above layouts were styled, but I did load some scss, which
   Jekyll processes for me automatically.

# Daily Tech Challenge #5
## Build a custom TextInput using React Native

I had so much fun using React Native for yesterday's challenge that I decided to
stick with it, this time diving a little deeper into UI design by creating a
custom text input.

Today's custom text input is going to enforce formatting and add a few visual
bells and whistles. I may try a few different types of custom inputs, but one,
for example, could display a specially formatted dollar sign before any numbers
that are entered. While I could certainly build such a thing in a web context, I
understand there to be styling quirks in React Native inherent to the
environment components run in, so this could be a real challenge.

I should mention up front that I will make no attempt to build something that is
cross platform. I expect the styling to get a little hacky, so the text input
needs to work in iOS only, although I will take a screenshot in the Android
simulator for comparison purposes.

Exposing routes in Google Kubernetes Engine to a domain name I own is something
I've done before, but these challenges are not only an opportunity to try new
things, but a chance to practice things I already know, whether I have them down
pat or am getting rusty (as is the case here).



## Future challenge ideas

 - Build twilio call answering bot with dial pad menu
 - Configure istio
 - Write implementation of Djikstra's pathfinding algorithm

I know I said I'd be working on Jekyll today, but there's been a change of
plans. For today's challenge, I'm going to build a very simple React Native app,
with the success metric being a more or less completely functional (if basic)
screen on my iPhone. I've never built a React Native app before, or an iPhone
app for that matter, but I have built and extended normal apps using React, so
I'm looking forward to a successful day dabbling in mobile!

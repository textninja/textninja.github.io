# Daily Tech Challenge #2
## Still Spinning K8s

<div class="authorship">Authored by Joe Taylor 12/31/2021</div>

Leaving [yesterday's
challenge](/posts/2021-12-30-daily-challenge-spin-up-django.html) half finished
and then moving on doesn't sit well with me. There's plenty of shiny new tech to
explore, but instead of doing my best magpie impression and reaching for what's
shiny, today I'm going to carry on where I left off, and get Django deployed in
Kubernetes, damn it!

I spent some time late last night reading Django's docs, and now feel at least a
little bit more familiar with its model of the world. I've also learned that
writing about solving a problem and actually solving it are distinct steps. For
that reason, I'm going to set aside an hour or so to actually focus on coding,
exploring, and figuring things out, and with the possible exception of notes to
self, only start writing when I'm ready to start over and document what I
learned.

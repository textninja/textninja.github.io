# Daily Tech Challenge #2
## Still Spinning K8s

<div class="authorship">Authored by Joe Taylor 12/31/2021</div>

Leaving [yesterday's
challenge](/posts/2021-12-30-daily-challenge-spin-up-django.html) half finished
and then moving on doesn't sit well with me. There's plenty of shiny new tech to
explore, but instead of doing my best magpie impression and reaching for what's
shiny, today I'm going to carry on where I left off, and get Django deployed in
Kubernetes, damn it!

I spent a bit of time this morning (before going to bed) reading Django's docs,
and now feel at least a little bit more familiar with its model of the world.
I've also learned that writing and programming--other than freeform notes--don't
go well together. For that reason, I'm going to set aside an hour or so to
actually focus on coding, exploring, and figuring things out, and only start
writing (more than scribbles) when I'm ready to start from scratch and document
what I learned.
